# React Effects (Advanced)

In this project, I am continuing the learning from [React Effects (Basics)](https://github.com/amanpreet04/react-effects). I built a Quiz Application where each question has four single-select answers along with a timer. While going through the questions, the user will be presented with immediate feedback (some CSS applied) depending on the selected option.

The intent was to get a grasp of concepts like Dependency Arrays, Cleanup Functions, Performance Optimization using `useCallback`, and Debugging `useEffect`.
