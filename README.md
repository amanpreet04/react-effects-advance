# React Effects (Advanced)

In this project, I am continuing the learning from [React Effects (Basics)](https://github.com/amanpreet04/react-effects).

The idea is to get a grasp over concepts like Dependency Arrays, Cleanup Functions, Performance Optimization using `useCallback`, and Debugging `useEffect`.
